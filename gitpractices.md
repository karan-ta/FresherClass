1) make a feature-branch - add 5 commits
2) take only the 4th commit from feature-branch into master branch
3) why to branch early and branch often - can you show with example
--------------------------------------------


1) make a feature-branch - add 5 commits     

2) take only the 4th commit from feature-branch into master branch    
3) create a new branch and switch to it with one command.    

4) make a file , add a line as "a line". commit it. now add one more line as "a new line" . now suppose you want the file to not contain the line "a new line" . how will you revert the file to its previous state/commit of just having "a line"

5) make a branch add 3 more commits. merge it in master - delete the branch

6) modify some files and directly commit them by skipping the staging area. how will you check the diff before committing ?
